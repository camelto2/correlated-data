FIT:    data read from 'tmp.dat' u 1:2
        format = x:z
        #datapoints = 3
        residuals are weighted equally (unit weight)

function used for fitting: f(x)
fitted parameters initialized with current variable values



 Iteration 0
 WSSR        : 2.70275e+06       delta(WSSR)/WSSR   : 0
 delta(WSSR) : 0                 limit for stopping : 1e-05
 lambda	  : 0.580381

initial set of free parameter values

a               = 1
b               = 1
c               = 1

After 4 iterations the fit converged.
final sum of squares of residuals : 6.05382e-07
rel. change during last iteration : -8.12292e-06


Exactly as many data points as there are parameters.
In this degenerate case, all errors are zero by definition.

Final set of parameters 
======================= 

a               = -948.142       
b               = -19.5369       
c               = 71.6794
