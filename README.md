# correlated-data

Let's start sharing the correlation energies for various atoms in this repository. To be consistent, I suggest using ROHF with UCCSD(T) (Dr.Mitas suggestion actually) for a given charge and multiplicty with uncontracted tz-dk, qz-dk, 5z-dk extrapolations. The data will look something like this:

Fe.ae.dat:
