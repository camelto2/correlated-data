# correlated-data

Dataset for "New generation of effective core potentials from correlated calculations: 3d transition metal series"

Included are various directories including atomic and molecular data for various ECPs. Gaussian and Molpro include input and output files for each code respectively. Each code directory is divided into atoms and molecules, containing individual directories for each species (e.g. Molpro/atoms/Fe or Gaussian/molecules/ZnO)
